# My portfolio
 
My first website using HTML, CSS, and WAI-ARIA.

My portfolio features a clean and modern design with a focus on user experience. The website is responsive and optimized for different devices, making it easy for visitors to navigate and view my projects.

In my portfolio, you'll find information about my education, skills, and experience in web development. You can also explore my projects, which demonstrate my expertise in JavaScript, React, and other front-end technologies.
